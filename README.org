* System Info
[[./images/desktop-stumpwm.png]]

- OS: Void GNU/Linux
- Shell: bash
- Terminal: alacritty
- WM: StumpWM
- Compositor: picom
- Text Editor: GNU Emacs

* Installing
Just execute the ~setup~ binary.  You don't need to run it with root permission.
#+begin_example
./setup
#+end_example

If you want to execute the source file, you'll need Quicklisp and some other
libraries.  Use the following command to load it.
#+begin_example
sbcl --load setup.lisp --eval "(main)"
#+end_example

* Configuration Details
I currently have literate configuration for GNU Emacs, so if you want to know
what does what, feel free to check out [[file:.emacs.d/init.org][init.el]].  there's also this [[file:.emacs.d/config.org][old config]] I
used to use, it's deprecated now, but still has some information in it.

I am also planning to add more literate configs for other softwares.

* Custom Keybindings in StumpWM
I mostly use the default keybindings that come with StumpWM, but I have changed
the *prefix key* to ~Super-t~ (or ~Windows-t~).  I have also exchanged the
~hsplit~ and ~vsplit~ keybinding.

* TODOs

  - [X] Package installation
  - [X] Flatpak installation
  - [X] Enable system services
